🌐 OPEN SOURCE SUMMER WEBSITE

A vibrant hub for students to showcase, collaborate, and build open-source projects during the summer.

Welcome to the Summer of Code web platform — a place where contributors young and old can gather to host their projects, share learning, and build real world code together. Whether you’re just getting started or deep into your first open-source contribution, this site is your summer sandbox! ☀️✨

🧠 About

This repository hosts the source for the Open Source Summer Website — a simple, student-focused platform that:

🎯 Lets students host and display open-source project work

🤝 Encourages collaboration by providing a lightweight web presence

🔧 Acts as a stepping stone into open source contribution culture

The goal of this project is to make open source summer contributions accessible and visible to everyone — students, mentors, and the community. It’s built with approachable web basics so contributors can jump in easily and grow their skills.

This project was originally forked from a similar summer_of_code template and expanded into a standalone collaboration space.

🚀 Features

✔️ Easy to host on GitHub Pages or any LAMP / PHP-based host
✔️ Designed for students to personalize with their own work
✔️ Encourages community contributions and friendly collaboration

📦 Technologies

This site is built with:
